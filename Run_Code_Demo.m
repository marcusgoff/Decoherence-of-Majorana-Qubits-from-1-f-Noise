% Description:
%   - Demo code which runs in under 10 minutes. Calculates and plots P_qpp
%     as a function of time for L = 3 microns, and for a TLF rate of 200
%     GHz, for 3 nanosecond or untill P_{qpp} = 0.1 (whichever occurs first),
%     this corresponds to the yellow line in figure 2b in the main tex). 
%
% Requirements:
%   - MATLAB R2024 or newer
%   - Dependencies: functions in /QPP_Library directory. 
%
% Output:
%   - Saves Figure_2b in the ./results
%   - Saves entire worskpace in the ./data directory
